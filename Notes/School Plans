Part of my educational plans are to earn a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems over the next two or three years, I will be 23 or 24,
And then to earn a master's at some point in the future, which will take me a while longer.

As of now, I have been applying for technical related positions, along with just any job to get myself employed and off the ground rolling.
